# Topic Model - Component
The topic_model folder within the components directory contains essential files related to the topic modeling process used in the Mental Health Dashboard project. Topic modeling allows the system to identify prevalent themes within the collected tweets, providing valuable insights into mental health discussions.

## Files
1. lda_model.model
lda_model.model is the serialized LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model. LDA is a popular topic modeling technique used to discover topics within a collection of documents (tweets, in this case). This file contains the trained LDA model.

2. lda_model.model.expElogbeta.npy
This file contains the exponential of the expected log probability of the topics (beta values) obtained during the LDA model training. It is a crucial component for understanding the topic-word distributions.

3. lda_model.model.id2word
lda_model.model.id2word is a mapping of word IDs to words in the vocabulary. It allows for the interpretation of the topics generated by the LDA model.

4. lda_model.model.state
lda_model.model.state contains the state of the LDA model, including random state information and other parameters used during training.

5. topics.json
topics.json is a JSON file that stores the extracted topics along with their corresponding keywords. Each topic is represented as a list of keywords, providing a human-readable summary of the topics identified by the LDA model.

## Usage
These files are utilized by the Mental Health Dashboard system to categorize tweets into relevant topics, allowing users to explore mental health discussions efficiently.

Note: These files are integral to the functioning of the Mental Health Dashboard.
