# Mental Health Dashboard - Backend
Welcome to the backend repository of the Mental Health Dashboard project! This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources related to the backend server of our innovative Mental Health Dashboard powered by Twitter data.

## Installation and Run
To get started, follow these steps to install and run the backend server:

Run the following command to start the app:
```bash
flask --app app.py run
```
or

```bash
flask run
```

The Flask application will automatically run since the main Python file is named app.py.

## Development

#### Auto genereate `requirements.txt`

To auto generate `requirements.txt` file, run the following command while in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
This command will capture all the dependencies and versions in your virtual environment and save them to the requirements.txt file for easy setup on other systems.
